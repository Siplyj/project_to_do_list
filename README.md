**About project**

This is my To Do List implementation. All data is stored in the browser's local storage. Tasks can be created, edited, deleted, moved by priority up and down the list. The status bar shows how many tasks have already been completed, and the "Remove completed tasks" button clears the list of already completed tasks.

**Technologies used**

HTML and CSS for creating a page<br/>
JavaScript for handling user events and manipulating the browser's local storage<br/>
Gulp with various modules is used for the assembly:

- browser-sync - for automatic page reloading and synchronous page scrolling on different devices
- gulp-autoprefixer - for automatically adding CSS prefixes
- gulp-csscomb - for structuring a CSS file
